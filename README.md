# DeepHINT for tensorflow v2.5.0

The original version of [DeepHINT](https://github.com/nonnerdling/DeepHINT) only works for the legacy version of keras (<2.4.0). 
Moreover, `data.py` has an issue with python version 3.
In other words, the version doen't work with the latest version of the tensorflow/python. 
It is necessarly to migrate the original DeepHINT if you want to run on the latest version of tensorflow.

I fortunately find a way to migrate and have updated the forked repository. You can feel free to use it, and if you have any questions, please e-mail me at jeong.compbio@gmail.com.
